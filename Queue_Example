Three types of requests are defined for a cloud queue:
•	+ d t: t is added to the end of the queue d times
•	- t: The first t elements are removed
•	?: What number is at the top of the queue? (If the queue is empty, the answer to the request is empty.)
Write a program that reads q requests from input and for each”?” request, Print the value of the queue head.
Sample Input 1
7
+ 4 3
+ 3 2
?
+ 1 3
- 4
+ 1 1
?
Sample Output 1
4
3
First, 4 enters the queue 3 times, then 3 enters the queue 2 times. So, on the third line in the call “?” The number 4, which is the first in the queue, must be printed. Then 1 is entered 3 times and we remove the first 4 elements from the beginning. Then we add a 1 to the queue. In the last call “?” Since the first 4 elements of the queue were removed, the first element of the queue is 3.

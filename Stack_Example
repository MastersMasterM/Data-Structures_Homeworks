You are given number n and then a string s of length 2*n consisting of parentheses.
You must print the number of the parentheses paired with each open and closed parenthesis.
It is guaranteed that for each “(“there exists one “)” in s.

Sample Input 1
1
()
Sample output 1
2 1
In this example, the first parenthesis is paired with the second parenthesis and the second parenthesis with the first parenthesis, so we print 2 and 1, respectively.
Sample Input 2
5
(())(()())
Sample Output 2
4 3 2 1 10 7 6 9 8 5
Your code should run in O(n)
